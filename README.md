Angular Client for Client Profiles and Car Albums
This Angular project serves as a client application for managing client profiles and their car albums. It interacts with a JSON fake API to retrieve data. The project features the following components:

Client Profiles:
Display a list of clients with their basic information (name, photo, etc.).
Clicking on a client’s name redirects to their detailed profile page.
Client Profile Page:
Show detailed information about a specific client.
Include personal details, contact information, and any other relevant data.
Provide links to view the client’s car albums.
Car Albums:
Each client has one or more car albums.
An album contains a series of photos showcasing the client’s cars.
Clicking on an album displays the photos in a gallery format.
